# stream-cipher-encryption-and-decrytion
This code implements stream cipher encryption and decryption using cpp. A UML diagram explaining the flow of the program is included in the repo.
You need to include paths to the files required. Like in this project we have considered sensors as files and we take input from these files. So u must 
include a path to these file(the folder must contain atleast 1 file to work). The rest u can understant from UML.pdf in the repo.
